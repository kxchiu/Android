The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### For a first real assignment: too big, too small, just right? #####
> The assignment is a bit more challenging that what I would expect for the first assignment. I was expecting more of a "playing out with basic elements" or "working with intent" kind of a thing.


##### What model device did you test your application on? What SDK did you target? #####
> I tested on the emulator and my target SDK is version 21.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I spent about 25 hours on this assignment (~10 hours researching and reading documentations and examples, ~10 hours coding the actual assignment, ~5 hours debugging)


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Jooniel, Luis, and the questions that are answered on Slack, as well as a couple questions/examples on Stack Overflow.
> JSON stuffs:
>   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7634518/getting-jsonobject-from-jsonarray
>   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3408985/json-array-iteration-in-android-java
> ViewStub stuffs:
>   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11577777/how-to-use-view-stub-in-android


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> The ViewStub is a bit tricky. It was not mentioned nor hinted, though it seems like people are using it to solve this assignment (maybe bacause of the discussion on Slack?). Also, the assignment description talks about providing sample code for JSON Object/Array, but we didn't have enough time to go over those :'(.
